# ⚡ Electricity Demand Prediction

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on **predicting future electricity demand** using historical electricity usage data from **January 2020 to December 2024**.  

The aim is to provide insights into **power consumption trends** and forecast **future demand**, helping stakeholders (such as governments, utility companies, and research institutions) make informed decisions for **energy planning and management**.  

By leveraging **machine learning techniques**, the project enables proactive measures to handle **demand fluctuations**, reduce **uncertainties**, and ensure a **reliable power supply**.
